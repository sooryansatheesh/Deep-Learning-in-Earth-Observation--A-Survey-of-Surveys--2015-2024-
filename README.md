# Deep Learning in Earth Observation: A Survey of Surveys (2015-2024)
 A comprehensive analysis of systematic review methodologies in Earth observation sciences, focusing on deep learning applications. This repository contains datasets and analysis from a two-part study examining 42 survey papers published between 2015-2024.

## Repository Structure
- `/dataset/` - Contains the main dataset files
  - `/dataset/Part-1/` - Contains the Part-1 dataset files
    - `dataset_v_1.csv` - Primary survey of surveys data
    - `code_book_v_1.pdf` - Code Book for the Part-1 dataset
  

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes systematic reviews in Earth observation domains published between 2015-2024, analyzing:
- Methodological rigor implementation
- PRISMA protocol compliance
- Research question formulation
- Dataset availability metrics
- Temporal and bibliometric patterns

### Key Components:
1. Methodological Rigor Index (MRI) metrics
2. PRISMA implementation scores
3. Publication temporal analysis
4. Quality classification metrics

## Usage
The datasets are available in CSV format and can be used for:
- Analyzing systematic review methodologies
- Studying research standardization patterns
- Evaluating publication quality metrics
- Bibliometric analysis of Earth observation literature

## Part I Focus
Current release focuses on:
- Implementation of systematic review protocols
- Temporal evolution of methodological rigor
- Standardization patterns across publication venues
- PRISMA protocol compliance analysis
- Dataset availability and reproducibility standards
